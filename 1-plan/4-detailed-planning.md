## Phase 4: Detailed Structuring

1.  **Component-Level Planning:** For each component identified in the `high-level-plan.md`, Copilot creates a new markdown file (e.g., `component-A.md`).

2.  **File-Level Structure:** Inside each component's markdown file, Copilot outlines the file-level structure. This includes:
    *   The names of the files to be created or modified for that component.
    *   For each file, a description of the classes, functions, and general structure that will be implemented.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** The user can review and edit these component-specific markdown files to refine the plan. This allows for detailed adjustments at a granular level before any code is written.

4.  **User Checkpoint:** Copilot reads the updated markdown files and confirms the changes with the user. This loop continues until the detailed structure for all components is finalized.
