## Phase 5: Final Plan Generation

1.  **Summarize Component Plans:** Copilot will process all the detailed component plans from the previous phase.

2.  **Generate Human-Readable Plan:** Copilot will create a `final-plan.md` file. This document will provide a concise, human-readable summary of the entire plan, drawing from the individual component markdown files.

3.  **Ready for Design Phase:** The user can review this `final-plan.md` to ensure it aligns with their vision before moving on to the design phase.
