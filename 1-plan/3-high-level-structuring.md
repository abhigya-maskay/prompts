## Phase 3: High-Level Structuring

1.  **Propose High-Level Structure:** Copilot creates a `high-level-plan.md` file. This file will outline the main components, modules, or files that need to be created or modified.

2.  **Iterative Refinement:** The user can directly edit the `high-level-plan.md` file to make changes, add details, or ask questions.

3.  **User Checkpoint:** Copilot will read the updated markdown file and confirm the changes with the user. This loop continues until the high-level plan is finalized.
