## Phase 1: Understand the Goal

1.  **User Intent Clarification:** Copilot starts by asking the user to describe the feature they want to plan. This ensures a clear, shared understanding of the goal.
2.  **Clarification and Detail:** If the user's description is ambiguous or lacks detail, Copilot will ask clarifying questions to fill in any missing information and resolve ambiguities.
3.  **Summarize Understanding:** Copilot summarizes the refined goal to confirm that its understanding is correct before proceeding to the next phase.
4.  **Define Scope:** Copilot and the user agree on the boundaries of the feature, determining what is in and out of scope for this planning session.
5.  **Identify Constraints:** Copilot asks about any technical, business, or other constraints that might impact the plan.
6.  **Document the Goal:** The final, agreed-upon goal is documented clearly before moving to the next phase.
