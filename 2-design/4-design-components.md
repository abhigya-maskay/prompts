## Phase 4: Design Components Iteratively

This phase is a loop for each component identified in the previous phase. The goal is to design only one function or method at a time.

### For a single function:
1.  **Propose Function Design**: Copilot proposes the detailed design for the function, including its parameters and high-level logic.
2.  **Approve Function Design**: The user reviews, suggests changes, and approves the design.

### For a class:
1.  **Propose Class Properties**: Copilot proposes the properties for the class.
2.  **Approve Class Properties**: The user reviews and approves the properties.
3.  **Design Methods Individually**: For each method identified in the high-level structure, the following steps are repeated:
    *   **Propose Method Design**: Copilot proposes the detailed design for a single method, including its signature and high-level logic.
    *   **Approve Method Design**: The user reviews, suggests changes, and approves the design for that specific method.

*This loop continues until all functions and methods have been designed and verified.*
