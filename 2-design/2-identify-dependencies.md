## Phase 2: Identify Dependencies

1.  **Propose Dependencies**: Copilot analyzes the context and proposes a list of other files or modules this file will depend on. Focus exclusively on code dependencies. Ignore system dependencies or anything required for deployment.
2.  **Confirm and Document Dependencies**: The user reviews, adds, or removes dependencies. Copilot then adds the confirmed list to the component's markdown file.
