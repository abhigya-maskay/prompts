## Phase 3: Outline High-Level Structure

1.  **Propose High-Level Structure**: Copilot proposes a high-level scaffold of the necessary classes and functions, including their type signatures. Copilot will actively look for opportunities to modularize and suggest splitting logic into generic utility functions.
2.  **Approve High-Level Structure**: The user reviews and approves the high-level structure, including any proposed utility functions, before detailing each part.
