## Phase 1: Define Core Responsibility and Verify Understanding

1.  **Verify Component Understanding**: Copilot reads the component outline from the specified markdown file and presents its understanding of the component's structure and functionality.
2.  **Refine Understanding**: The user reviews Copilot's understanding, provides corrections, and confirms when the understanding is accurate.
3.  **Propose Core Responsibility**: Copilot proposes a one-sentence description of the file's main purpose.
4.  **Confirm Core Responsibility**: The user reviews, edits, and confirms the core responsibility.
