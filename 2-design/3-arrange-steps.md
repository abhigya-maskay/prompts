## Phase 3: Arrange Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Dependencies**: Copilot reads the dependency sections from all detailed-planning files to understand the relationships between components.
2. **Identify Blocking Dependencies**: Copilot identifies which components depend on others and maps out the dependency chain to prevent implementation blocking.
3. **Propose Implementation Order**: Copilot proposes a reordered sequence of components that ensures dependencies are satisfied before dependents are implemented.
4. **Validate Order**: The user reviews the proposed order and confirms it prevents blocking issues during implementation.
5. **Rename Files**: Copilot renames the component files to match the correct implementation order, ensuring sequential numbering reflects dependency-aware ordering.
