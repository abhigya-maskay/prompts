## Phase 1: Test Plan Generation

1. **Target Code Analysis:** Copilot analyzes the specified code file to understand its structure, functions, classes, and dependencies.

2. **Test Strategy Development:** 
   * Copilot identifies all testable units (functions, methods, classes)
   * Maps out test scenarios including happy paths, edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
   * Determines mock requirements and test data needs
   * Focus on unit tests

3. **Test Plan Creation:** Copilot generates a comprehensive test plan document that includes:
   * List of all tests to be written
   * Test descriptions with expected inputs and outputs
   * Priority order for implementation
   * Required test setup and dependencies

4. **User Checkpoint:** The user reviews the test plan markdown file, suggests modifications, and provides approval before proceeding to implementation.

5. **Plan Finalization:** Once approved, the test plan becomes the roadmap for the iterative implementation process.
