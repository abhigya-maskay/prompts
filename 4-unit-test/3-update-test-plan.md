## Phase 3: Test Plan Updates

1. **Test Completion Marking:** Copilot removes the completed test from the active test plan, marking it as implemented.

2. **Progress Documentation:** 
   * Updates the test plan with completion status
   * Documents any changes made during implementation
   * Records any insights or modifications from the implementation process

3. **Plan Review:** Copilot presents the updated test plan showing:
   * Completed tests (marked as done)
   * Remaining tests to be implemented
   * Current progress status

4. **User Checkpoint:** The user confirms the test plan updates and provides direction:
   * Approves moving to the next test
   * Requests changes to remaining test priorities
   * Adds or removes tests based on implementation insights

5. **Next Test Preparation:** Once confirmed, Copilot prepares to implement the next test in the plan, returning to Phase 2 for the iterative cycle.
