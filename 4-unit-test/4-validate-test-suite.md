## Phase 4: Test Suite Validation

1. **Completion Verification:** Copilot confirms that all tests from the original plan have been implemented and approved.

2. **Test Suite Integration:**
   * Combines all individual tests into a cohesive test suite
   * Ensures proper test organization and structure
   * Verifies test isolation and independence

3. **Execution Validation:**
   * Runs the complete test suite to ensure all tests pass
   * Identifies and resolves any integration issues
   * Validates test coverage and completeness

4. **User Checkpoint:** The user performs final review of the complete test suite:
   * Validates test coverage meets expectations
   * Reviews test quality and maintainability
   * Confirms the test suite is ready for use

5. **Final Approval:** Once the user provides final approval, the test suite development process is complete.
