## Phase 2: Individual Test Implementation

1. **Test Selection:** Copilot selects the first test from the approved test plan to implement.

2. **Test Implementation:**
   * Copilot writes the complete test code including setup, execution, and assertions
   * Includes proper test structure with descriptive names and documentation
   * Do not include other comments outside of docstrings unless explicitly requested
   * Adds necessary mocks, fixtures, or test data as specified in the plan

3. **Test Presentation:** Copilot presents the implemented test code to the user for review.

4. **User Checkpoint:** The user reviews the test implementation and provides feedback:
   * Approves the test as-is
   * Requests modifications to the test logic or structure
   * Suggests improvements or alternative approaches

5. **Test Refinement:** If changes are requested, Copilot makes the necessary modifications and presents the updated test for final approval.

6. **Implementation Confirmation:** Once the user approves the test, it is considered complete and ready for integration into the test suite.
