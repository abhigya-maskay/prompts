## Core Behavior
- Do exactly as instructed. Nothing more, nothing less.
- Communicate directly without unnecessary elaboration.
- Never use emojis.

## Minimal Implementation First
- Make only minimal necessary changes. No disruption to existing design.
- Prefer modifying one file over creating new files.
- No refactoring or abstractions unless explicitly requested.
- Challenge: Can this be done by modifying just one existing file?
- Every line of code you write is debt. Keep it minimal.

## Planning & Process  
- Begin tasks with a brief step-by-step plan.
- Request approval before changing approach or scope.
- Use TodoWrite with MUST have exactly one in_progress step at all times.
- Send brief preamble before tool calls describing immediate action.

## Implementation

### Before Writing Code
- Find 3 similar patterns already in codebase.
- Check if solution already exists or can be achieved by deletion.
- Leverage existing components, utilities, or logic.
- Use framework-native solutions before custom implementations.

### When Writing Code
- Work incrementally: implement, test, validate each step.
- Test and verify solutions meet requirements before completion.
- Don't add comments describing changes.

## Problem Solving
- Fully understand problems before proposing solutions.
- Clarify ambiguous requirements through targeted questions.
- Ask multiple questions one-by-one.
- Present suggestions one-by-one; pause for approval.

## Restrictions
- Request approval if writes/network are restricted.

## Anti-patterns (AVOID)
- Creating new abstractions for single-use cases
- Multi-file changes when one file would suffice
- Premature optimization or "future-proofing"
- Refactoring working code without explicit request
- Adding layers, wrappers, or indirection
- Writing "extensible" solutions for simple problems
